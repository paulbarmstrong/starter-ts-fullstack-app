## starter-ts-fullstack-app

### About

This is a minimal example of a fully self-contained TypeScript fullstack app. It's an NPM workspaces monorepo that
contains the following NPM workspace packages:

* **cdk** - A TypeScript AWS CDK app that defines all the infrastructure for the fullstack app
* **common** - A TypeScript library package that contains code used by the other packages in the app
* **http-api** - A TypeScript AWS API gateway lambda event handler which uses DynamoDB to implement some minimal APIs
* **webapp** - A TypeScript React app defining a minimal webapp that interacts with the HTTP API

Please feel free to fork this repo and turn it into whatever you want. This repo uses the Unlicense license which means
it is released into the public domain.

### Usage

#### Prerequisites

1. AWS credentials present in your development environment
2. Node and NPM installed

#### Installation

1. Clone the repo and open a terminal in the root directory
2. `npm install --workspaces`
3. `npm run cdk -w cdk bootstrap aws://<account-id>/<region>` (replace `<account-id>` and `<region>` with your AWS account ID and desired
region)

#### Build & Deployment

1. `npm run build -w common` (only necessary on first build or when editing common package)
2. `npm run start -w cdk` (this will create a CloudFormation stack in your AWS account called "Grid" containing all the
app's infrastructure)
3. The app is hosted at the `Grid.WebsiteUrl` from the output of the previous command

#### Building webapp locally

1. Add `packages/webapp/public/config.json` containing this, where `<Grid.HttpApiEndpoint>` is the `Grid.HttpApiEndpoint` output from the previous command:

```
{ "httpApiEndpoint": "<Grid.HttpApiEndpoint>" }
```
2. `npm run start -w webapp`

#### Uninstallation

1. Delete your local clone of the repo
2. `npm uninstall -g cdk`
3. Delete the "Grid" CloudFormation stack from your AWS account
